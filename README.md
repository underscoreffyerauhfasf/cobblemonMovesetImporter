# cobblemonMovesetImporter
A tool to import movesets from before Generation 9 back into Cobblemon.
## About the project
The cobblemonMovesetImporter (stylized as Cobblemon Moveset Importer and shortened to CMI from henceforth) is a tool made to automatically create and package datapacks for Cobblemon that restore Pokemon's movesets. The end goal is to allow free customization of specific parameters, so that the user can have complete control over what to allow and deny. As of right now however, the project is simply in beta.
## Origins of the project
I believe Generation 9's learnsets are silly. Why remove moves a Pokemon has already previously learned? I've always been opinionated on the matter, so learning that Cobblemon followed Generation 9 learnsets to a T irked me. In fact, it irked me enough to make this program! I figured there must be at least one other person out there that shares my irked-iness, so I want to share the Cobblemon Moveset Importer with the world.
## How to contribute
Feel free to open a pull request at any time! Any new features, bugfixes, etc. contributed to the CMI are greatly appreciated.
